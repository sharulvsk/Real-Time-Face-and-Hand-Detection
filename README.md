                                                                           Face and Hand Landmarks Detection using Mediapipe and OpenCV
                                🚀 Project Overview
This project implements real-time face and hand landmarks detection using Mediapipe and OpenCV. It processes video feed from a webcam to detect and visualize:

Facial landmarks with mesh contours
Hand landmarks with precise joint connections (both left and right hands)
Real-time FPS (Frames Per Second) display
The program utilizes Mediapipe's robust Holistic Model for multi-modal human pose and gesture recognition.

                                📋 Features
Facial Landmark Detection
Highlights 468 unique points on the face, visualized as a mesh.

Hand Landmark Detection
Detects and connects 21 key points on each hand, including wrist, fingers, and palm.

Real-Time Performance
Displays FPS to evaluate the efficiency of the detection process.

Landmark Coordinates
Outputs exact positions of detected landmarks for further analysis.

                                🔧 Installation
Install Python 3.7+
Download and install Python from python.org.

Clone or Download the Repository

git clone https://github.com/sharulvsk/Real-Time-Face-and-Hand-Detection.git
cd face-hand-landmarks-detection
Install Dependencies Install required libraries via pip:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe
Run the Script

python landmarks_detection.py

                                🖥️ Usage Instructions
                                
Launch the script to start the webcam feed.
The detected landmarks (face and hands) will be drawn directly on the video feed.
Press q to exit the program.
